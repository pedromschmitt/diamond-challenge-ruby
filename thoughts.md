My thoughs

============

This weekend I was traveling across the country to celebrate the 80ยบ birthday of my grandpa.
I thought about the test all the way while driving.

It was good and allow me to seat at my notebook after the party with lot of ideas.

But even so, I needed to spend almost 3 hours to finish it.

I had to google a few things. And I did mistakes..

One was that I ever tend to start an array with "Array.new()", but it never works the way I thought... and then 
I remember that I need to use "().to_a"

I also had to google how RSpec works in a ruby file. Before that, I only utilized RSpec at Rails.
But then I saw that everything was already configured by you guys (thanks).

I enjoyed the challenge. And I know that the code can be better, given time.
For example, Rubocop complained that I had a method with too many lines and lines with more than 80 char.

I want to google about this kata and see other answers of more experienced people, to saw better-looking and clever 
ways they used to complete it.
